# My first post!

::: info
Hey, it's me, CakesTwix. :tada:
:::

I made this site for fun, because there was nothing to do and here I made the news function, thanks for that xtimms.

## What we have at the moment
- Main pages
- Instructions
- Firmware from A10, A13, A14
- And the same news

## Plans
- Add all the firmware I can find
- Improve the design
- Find icons in the same style
- Anything else...?

## To you
I'm going to keep supporting with castoffs for at least another year. And then as it goes, I can build A15, well, I will support it for another year (if the phone will be in my hands, of course).
